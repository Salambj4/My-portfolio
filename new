# PART A — SYSTEM JUSTIFICATION REPORT

## 2. Folder Structure Justification

### Structure Used:

```
/eco-site
│
├── /config
├── /auth
├── /admin
├── /public
├── /assets
└── database.sql
```

### Why This Structure Was Used:

This folder layout follows **modern professional web development practices**, ensuring that:

* Code is **modular and organised**
* Security risks are reduced
* Files are easy to maintain and expand

### Folder Purposes:

| Folder         | Purpose                                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/config`      | Stores sensitive configuration files such as database connections. Prevents code duplication. |
| `/auth`        | Handles authentication logic such as login, registration, logout, and sessions.               |
| `/admin`       | Contains admin-only systems, protected via role validation.                                   |
| `/public`      | Public user-facing pages.                                                                     |
| `/assets`      | Stores CSS, JavaScript, and UI resources.                                                     |
| `database.sql` | Centralised SQL schema for database structure.                                                |

This separation improves **security, scalability, debugging, and maintainability**.

## 3. Database System Justification

### Technologies Used:

* MySQL Database
* PHP PDO (PHP Data Objects)

### Why PDO Was Used:

PDO provides:

* SQL injection protection
* Secure prepared statements
* Clean error handling
* Database portability

This makes the system **enterprise-level secure**.

### Database Tables Used:

| Table              | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `users`            | Stores user authentication credentials and roles |
| `calculator_logs`  | Records carbon calculations                      |
| `contact_messages` | Stores contact submissions                       |
| `bookings`         | Stores booking records                           |

This structure ensures **data integrity, audit trails, and accountability**.

## 4. Authentication System Justification

### Components:

* Register
* Login
* Logout
* Session Handling
* Role Validation

### Why Authentication Was Required:

Authentication allows:

* Role-based access restrictions

This ensures **high security against brute-force attacks, data breaches, and unauthorised access**.

---

## 5. Role-Based Admin System Justification

### Admin Capabilities:
